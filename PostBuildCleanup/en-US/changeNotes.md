# Post Build Cleanup - Change Notes

#### 4.0.0
- Update task to Node 16 (the task now supports Node 10, Node 16, and Node 20).
- Small fix to make the task work better with YAML pipelines (see [YAML Guidance](./yamlGuidance.md) for guidance on cleanup and YAML pipelines).

#### 3.1.1
- Bump version of the azure-pipelines-task-lib to get rid of NodeJS warning `Warning: Use Cipheriv for counter mode of aes-256-ctr`.

#### 3.1.0
- Fix issue with disabling NodeJS certificate check.
- Support pipelines with decorators; task does not need to be the last in a job/phase anymore.

#### 3.0.9
- Fix an out-dated link in the task description.

#### 3.0.8
- Update extension manifest to include links to license, and GitHub repository for issue tracking.
- Fix doc bugs.
- Add YAML documentation.

#### 3.0.7
- Fix post-job script to only run if the Post Build Cleanup task itself actually ran and cleanup is activated.

#### 3.0.6
- Update docs to reflect the new *Azure DevOps Services* brand.

#### 3.0.5
- Fixed an issue with log messages not showing up correctly (error: Resource file haven\'t set, can\'t find loc string for key: WaitForTaskCompletion).
- Fixed an issue with post-job script running on a timeout because it was waiting for itself to finish.

#### 3.0.4
- Fixed an issue with the task when used with other tasks that have post-job scripts (e.g., npm Authenticate).

#### 3.0.3
- Fixed extension target definition. Due to new vsts-node-api the lowest compatible version of Team Foundation Server is 2017 update 3. For earlier versions of Team Foundation Server, please keep using version 2.1.2.

#### 3.0.2
- Fixed links to documentation.

#### 3.0.1
