#### 7.4.6
- Fix null reference in statistics generation.

#### 7.4.5
- Always show all warning changes in statistics output.

- Include .NET Core task in the default task filters.
- Add warning statistics support for custom warning filters with predefined named groups.
- Fix doc issues.

#### 7.1.0

#### 6.4.2
- Fail code coverage policy if *Use Uncovered Elements* is enabled and there is no code coverage data or the task cannot read the data from Azure DevOps.
- **!SCOPE CHANGE!** Since we received a lot of feedback after adding the additional security scopes *vso.code_write* and *vso.code_status*, we decided to remove them from the extension again. Those scopes do not affect pipeline tasks as their abilities are only tied to the permissions granted to the build service accounts. As security and privacy are important topics everybody should be concerned about, we put together detailed information in our [FAQ](https://github.com/MicrosoftPremier/VstsExtensions/blob/master/BuildQualityChecks/en-US/FAQ.md#general).

#### 6.4.1
- Add policy result output variables.
- Publish policy results as PR statuses.
- Task filters now match against the display name as well as the task name.
- Add better error handling around enumeration-based task parameters (e.g., coverageType) to deal with typos in YAML files.
- Add support for evaluating warnings from arbitrary log files based on regular expression warning filters.
- **!SCOPE CHANGE!** This version of the task requires two additional security scopes for Azure DevOps: *vso.code_write* and *vso.code_status*. These scopes are required in order to publish pull request statuses and create pull request comments (see [Pull Request Status API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/git/pull%20request%20statuses/create?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1) for more information).

#### 6.4.0
- Skipped due to publishing error.

#### 6.3.0
- Fix comparison issue with warnings policy.
- Add support for using uncovered elements when evaluating the code coverage policy (thanks for the suggestion, mjvk!).

#### 6.2.4
- Fix warning statistics creation when new baseline is forced or no baseline exists.

#### 6.2.3
- Fail policies with correct error message when invalid YAML inputs are provided.
- Fix policy result for warnings policy when baseline build is missing.

#### 6.2.2
- Fix baseline build handling for old build pipelines.

#### 6.2.0
- Fix handling of parallel build jobs to ensure that warnings are only compared to warnings from the correct job of a previous build.
- Add option to log task warnings and errors as build issue (enabled by default).
- Fix bug that would not fail the coverage policy if delta type was absolute, ignoreDecreaseAboveUpperThreshold was enabled, and coverage value was above 100.
- Add precision parameter.
- Fix default task filters to properly work with YAML pipelines.
- Fix MSBuild log analysis to ensure that all warnings are captured.

#### 6.1.2
- Support using the global regex flag (/g) for warning filters.

#### 6.1.1
- Fix double counting of warnings when warning filters were combined with warning statistics.

#### 6.1.0
- Add option to include filtered warnings in addition to regularly detected warnings.

#### 6.0.0
- Change default behavior of the "Force Coverage Improvement" setting. The policy does not fail if the code coverage decreases but still remains above the upper threshold. To revert back to the old behavior, unselect the new "Ignore Decrease Above Threshold" option.
- Change default behavior of the "Force Filter" setting. The policy now fails if it cannot find code coverage data associated with the specified configuration and platform. 
- Add support for new code coverage backend in Azure DevOps (better performance and reliability).
- Fix a bug that kept the task waiting for skipped previous tasks.

#### 5.2.4
- Increase default wait timeouts.

#### 5.2.3
- Add YAML documentation.

#### 5.2.2
- Update extension manifest to include links to license, GitHub repository for issue tracking, and build badge.

#### 5.2.1
- Fix a null reference in the new force filter logic.

#### 5.2.0
- Add support for only evaluating code coverage data that is not associated with a platform and configuration as created by 3rd party tools like Cobertura.
- Add variable BQC.ForceNewBaseline to force a new baseline build.

#### 5.1.0
- Group warnings by build task in the task output and summary section (thanks to Mike W. for the suggestion).
- Add support for StyleCop log analysis.

#### 5.0.6
- Update docs to reflect the new *Azure DevOps Services* brand.

#### 5.0.5
- Disable generic log analysis if no warning filters are configured. Previous behavior resulted in the task not counting warnings from non-MSBuild-based build tasks if warning statistics were enabled.

#### 5.0.4
- Fix a bug that failed the code coverage policy if the 'Force Coverage Improvement' option was set and the percentage coverage value increased while the absolute coverage value decreased (e.g., baseline was 180 of 200 blocks covered = 90%, current build has 143 of 150 blocks covered = 95%).

#### 5.0.2
- Fix a bug that would sometimes compare the current build against the wrong build phases/jobs from the previous build.
- Fix links to pictures in the Visual Studio Marketplace.
 
#### 5.0.0
- Update vsts-node-api and vsts-task-lib to latest versions. This also fixes a localization issue that lead to warnings about missing resource files.
- Increase precision of comparison of code coverage percentage values. If no variance is supplied, percentage values will use four decimals instead of the previous two. This picks up a change of one element (e.g., block) in a million elements. When used with variance, the precision will be taken from the variance value.

#### 4.0.4
- Fix typo in the code that might lead to code coverage policy waiting indefinitely when there is no code coverage data in a build.

#### 4.0.3
- Fix vsts-node-api initialization bug in code coverage policy that sometimes leads to the error "Cannot read property 'getCodeCoverageSummary' of undefined".

#### 4.0.2
- Fix extension target definition. Due to new vsts-node-api the lowest compatible version of Team Foundation Server is 2017 update 3. For earlier versions of Team Foundation Server, please keep using version 3.0.1.

#### 4.0.1
- Fix summary section for multi-config builds (missing job information)

#### 4.0.0
- Added support for build phases.
- Added support for YAML builds.
- Removed the incorrect default value for build platform.
- Moved official documentation to https://github.com/MicrosoftPremier (thanks for the feedback, Jens J.).
- Removed support for Team Foundation Server 2015 due to incompatibility with the latest vsts-node-api.

#### 2.0.2
- Added back support for Team Foundation Server 2015 (was broken since v1.5.0). See [known issues](./overview.md#known-issues)

  [Baseline Task Parameters](./overview.md#baseline)
